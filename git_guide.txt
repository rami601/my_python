weclome to git steps for adding your repo (your project)to github

first of all you need to have an acount on github and you need to download git tool on your computer
after that run  "ssh-keygen" command on your terminal or cmd for gerating keys for ssh connection  after gerating the keys you will see the path where the keys has been saved go to 
go to the path  usaully  C:\Users\</username>\.ssh     go to the path and you will find files  pick the file with the .pub extantion copy its content
do not delete the file just copy its content and go to your github acount and go to your profile and then go to the setting page look for  SSH and GPG keys and then add the content that you copyed to the ssh key

1- create a new repo on  your github  acount , when you create a new repo you will see commands make sure to save the commands under
    push an existing repository from the command line , you have to save because we will need them later for pushing our project
    to the repo that we just created 
    the commands will look like these 
                    |
                   \|/
                    |
    git remote add origin git@github.com:rami601/<repo name>.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main

2 - go to your project directory 

3 -open the terminal in the main project directory

4 - run these command in the terminal for adding git path and setting the needed configeration for git

    1 - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    2 - git config --global user.email "you@youraddress.com"
    3 - git config --global push.default matching
    4 - git config --global alias.co checkout
    5 - git init

5 - add the project to the git , these two command will decide which files will be push to github later
    
    1 - git add .                                  # the dot means everthing in this directory
    2 - git commit -am "type here any thing you want "

6 - run the commands that you saved when you created the repo on github

    1 - git remote add origin git@github.com:rami601/<repo name>.git
    2 - git branch -M main       # be for you run this command you will see in  your terminal (main) or (master) if it was master changer ther command form git branch -M main to git branch -M master
    3 - git push -u origin main  # and do the same thing for this command
